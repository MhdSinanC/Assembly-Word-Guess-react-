## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** (with `useState`)  
- **Vite** as build & dev tool  
- **clsx** for conditional class names  
- **confetti-react** for celebratory UI  
- CSS (component / modular styling)  
- JavaScript ES6+  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn  

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MhdSinanC/Assembly-Word-Guess-react-.git
cd Assembly-Word-Guess-react-
npm install
# or
yarn install
````

### Running Locally (development)

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This runs Vite in development mode. The app should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port as shown in terminal).

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This outputs a `dist/` folder with static files. You can deploy this to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

## 📁 Project Structure

Here’s a simplified view of your repo layout:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── index.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── utils.js
│   ├── languages.js
│   └── components/ (optional after refactor)
├── index.css
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md
```

You may choose to further break `App.jsx` into smaller components (e.g. `Keyboard`, `WordDisplay`, `GameStatusBox`, etc.).

## ⚙️ How It Works (Overview)

1. On mount (or new game), choose a random word (`getRandomWord`).
2. Maintain state of `guessedLetters`.
3. Calculate how many wrong guesses there have been.
4. Determine game state: won, lost, or still playing.
5. Render:

   * The hidden word (letters or blanks)
   * The “language chips” showing lost ones with skull overlay
   * The alphabet “keyboard” buttons
   * The status box (win/lose/farewell)
6. On button click, add guessed letter (if not already guessed).
7. If the game ends, show “New Game” button to reset.

## 🔮 Possible Enhancements / To-Do Ideas

* Add **animation** for wrong guesses
* Add **difficulty levels** (longer words, fewer guesses)
* Add **hints** or **definitions**
* Keep **score / history** of played games
* Use **React Context** or **reducers** if state grows
* Add **unit tests** (Jest + React Testing Library)
* Improve **responsiveness / mobile UI**
